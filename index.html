		<h1>Ventures into the Art World</h1>
		<h2>by Audrey Springer</h3>
	<div style="text-align:left">
		<p>Art has been a part of human culture throughout all of time. It changes us just as much as we change it. Though many people will look at certain art forms and wonder if it could even be <em>considered</em> as art, I believe that every form of creative expression is art in it's own way. On this page you can find many of my favorite pieces.</p>

		<h4><em>"Bridge"</em> by Pino Pascali in 1968. I have had a liking for this particular statue ever since my visit to MoMA in New York City.</h4>

		<h4><em>"Waterlilies"</em> by Claude Monet. Much larger in person, this painting easily caught my eye with its intricate layering.</h4>

		<h4><em>"Countdown to Tomorrow"</em> by German Group ZERO. This piece and the collection it is from are very innovative because they are focused on movement in art.</h4>

		<h4><em>"Self Portrait II"</em> by Chuck Close. Chuck Close was originally a photorealist, but a crippling injury prevented him from painting like that ever again. Instead of giving up, he developed this new style.</h4>

		<h4><em>"Quartet (See For Yourself)"</em> by Gelnnray Tutor. This painting exhibits a beautiful sense of realism.</h4>

		<h4> <em>"The Portuguese"</em> by Georges Braque. I have always been fascinated by this painting and the sense of depth generated by its cubist style.
